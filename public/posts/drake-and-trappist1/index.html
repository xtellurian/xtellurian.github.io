<p>He&rsquo;s most famous for the Drake Equation, which provides a method for estimating the number of active, intelligent and communicating civilisations in the Milky Way Galaxy - i.e. it tells you how many aliens are out there.</p>

<p>This planetary system recently discovered has 7 Earth-sized planets orbiting a single star! Three of those planets are orbiting within the <em>habitable zone</em> - the &ldquo;goldilocks area&rdquo;, where conditions are just-right to support life. Strangely enough, all these planets are orbiting closer to their star than Mercury is to our own sun. Trappist-1 is an ultra-cool dwarf star. Consequently the planets can be much closer to their star and still may contain liquid water, crucial for life as we know it.</p>
<p>In the next few years, several space telescopes will observe the system, looking for clues to the development of extra-terrestrial life. Most exciting: the <a

  >James-Webb Space Telescope</a> scheduled to launch in 2018.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spitzer, Hubble, and Kepler will help astronomers plan for follow-up studies using NASA&rsquo;s upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, launching in 2018. With much greater sensitivity, Webb will be able to detect the chemical fingerprints of water, methane, oxygen, ozone, and other components of a planet&rsquo;s atmosphere. Webb also will analyze planets&rsquo; temperatures and surface pressures – key factors in assessing their habitability.</p></blockquote>
<p>What the Trappist-1 discovery implies is that the average rate of Earth-like planets-per-star may be much higher than we previously thought (the third factor in the Drake equation: ne). There&rsquo;s a lot of alien worlds out there.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>
Drake and NASA teamed up to find aliens</p>
