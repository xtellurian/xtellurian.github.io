      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Broken Steps&lt;/em&gt; is a guide to responsible travel, written by my friend Tamshuk Saha. It&amp;rsquo;s words resonated with me, as it expressed many of my own thoughts and feelings. Tamshuk addresses both the socially and environmentally destructive practices prevalent in the tourism industry throughout Asia. In the following I present a synopsis of the book, followed by an attempt to express his principles in my own words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-broken-steps-a-synopsis&#34;&gt;Our Broken Steps: A Synopsis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tamshuk discusses three categories of unethical travel practices:  not-so-eco-friendly travel, humanitarian abuse, and clash of cultures. The book is written in the style of a travel-guide, describing many harmful activities, and providing simple solutions that any tourist could undertake. The book is not long, and I encourage you to read it before traveling in Asia or elsewhere. Its available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/OUR-BROKEN-STEPS-Insights-Responsible-ebook/dp/B01MZ51V5F&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and you can follow Tamshuk at his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tamzexplores.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
