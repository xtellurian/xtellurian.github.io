      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened-in-pokemon&#34;&gt;What happened in Pokemon?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember Pokemon on GameBoy. An excellent game with many characters. Like all games (till now - more on that soon) the conversations were somewhat forced. The most creative moment was choosing your name in the beginning. Almost all my interactions with non-player chracters (NPC) involved multiple choice answers at best, and pre-canned conversations at worst.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://xtellurian.github.io/images/NLU/Pokemonconversationscreenshot.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of a simple Yes or No answer to a question in Pokemon for Gameboy&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
