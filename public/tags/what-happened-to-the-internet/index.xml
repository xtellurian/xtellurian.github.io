      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the late 20th century, the pioneers of the internet and a new generation of online radicals envisioned a future where free communication, access to information, and equality of access made people increasingly fair minded, intelligent, and empathetic.

Computers were large and expensive, and commonly used for transferring scientific or research data across multiple sites. During this phase, a key design goal was to build a non-centralised network; basically to build a robust communication system that could survive major catastrophes (aka nuclear war). Almost nobody at this time was thinking of the social impact of the technology. The whole point was to build networks that didn&amp;rsquo;t have a centre.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
