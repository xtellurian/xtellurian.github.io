  <h3><a href="/posts/blazor-blog/">Blogging with Blazor and Cloudflare</a></h3>
  <p>December 13, 2023</p>
  
  <p><p><a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> is a dotnet/ C# based web app framework. It promises that you&rsquo;ll be able to <strong>&ldquo;build full stack web apps without writing a line of JavaScript.&rdquo;</strong> At time of writing, this post is hosted on a Blazor frontend application. While building the blogging engine, I discovered that Blazor is cool, it runs on <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a>, it&rsquo;s a good dev experience, but it&rsquo;s no substitute for JavaScript (yet).</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>I decided to use a Blazor WASM project for this site, because I wanted to run it on Cloudflare pages. Pages are awesome because they run on Cloudflare&rsquo;s edge network, AND they come for free. Unfortunately, while Cloudflare does offer a &ldquo;server-side&rdquo; environment (called Cloudflare Workers), they only support a Javascript runtime. For full-stack Blazor (including server-side rendering) a different hosting service might be required.</p></p>

  <h3><a href="/posts/cherry_reflections/">Reflections on a startup</a></h3>
  <p>July 19, 2022</p>
  
  <p><p>For the last 18 months I&rsquo;ve been building a startup, but we&rsquo;ve decided to close it down. It was a tough decision, but the right one. Even though it failed, I have only minor regrets. The company failed to grow, but I experienced personal growth that would be unachievable in a regular job. Would I do it again? Yes.</p>
<p>Cherry Recommends was a SaaS platform (not really, but the term&rsquo;s in vogue) for improving the effectiveness of promotions in e-commerce. We used machine learning algorithms to target individual customers with &ldquo;the best&rdquo; promotion. When used in properly, Cherry could increase revenue (yes, <em>revenue</em>) by 15%. Honestly, we thought it was pretty cool. It was ugly, it was hard to use, and hard to explain - but with financial outcomes like that, we were confident we&rsquo;d find a way. But after 9 months of searching, we just weren&rsquo;t able to acquire new customers at anything near the required rate. We tried changing the our target customer, changing our brand, changing our messaging, and changing our pricing. But those things weren&rsquo;t the problem. The problem was simple: people did not want to buy our product.</p></p>

  <h3><a href="/posts/secret-to-event-processing/">A secret to Event Processing</a></h3>
  <p>May 20, 2022</p>
  
  <p><p>At Cherry, we process hundreds of events per second. For Cherry users, we capture and process data every time their customers visit a web page, take an action, purchase an item, etc. Processing events is a mission critical function to understand customer behaviour in real time. So when we discovered that processing latency for some Cherry users was several days, finding and solving the issue became our #1 priority.</p>
<p>I wrote this to help anyone in a similar position and share what we learned.</p></p>
